## ‚ú® Core Features

This project is being built in phases. Here is the current status:

-   [x] **Interactive Map of Japan:** Utilizes Leaflet.js with modern CartoDB map tiles for a clean aesthetic.
-   [x] **Custom Pin Dropping:** Click anywhere on the map to add a new "spot" to your plan.
-   [x] **Data Persistence:** All pins are automatically saved to the browser `localStorage`, so data is preserved between sessions.
-   [x] **Visited vs. Planned Status:** Each pin can be toggled between "Planned" (blue) and "Visited" (green), with corresponding color changes on the map.
-   [ ] **Route Planning:** Select multiple pins to visualize a travel route.
-   [ ] **Notes & Categories:** Add custom notes and tags (e.g., "Food", "Shrine", "Shopping") to each pin.
-   [ ] **PWA Functionality:** Installable on Android devices with basic offline support.
-   [ ] **AI-Powered Suggestions:** (Future Goal) Integrate the Gemini LLM to get travel recommendations.
